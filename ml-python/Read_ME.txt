There are 3 Folders  

1)Environment Folder 
contain the files needed for the algorithms to run in the singel and multi agent Environment


2)Singel_Agent_Algos Folder
contain the 3 Python implementation for 3 differnt algorithms and there unity connection 

 
2.1)Q_Lerning.py 
open the Q_Lerning.py and simply run it the unity Environment will run automatically
 

2.2)Poilcy_Gradient.py 
open the Poilcy_Gradient.py and simply run it the unity Environment will run automatically


2.3) Actor_Critc
open the Actor_Critc.py and simply run it the unity Environment will run automatically


2.4) unity.py 
have the implementation of the TCP coneciton betwen python and singel_Agent_unity_Environment


3)Multi_Agent_Algo
contain the Python implementation of the Multi_Agent_Actor_Critc algorithm and its unity connection 


3.1)Harry_And_Thieves_A2c 
you simply need to run the code and the Environment will run automatically

3.2) unity.py 
have the implementation of the TCP coneciton betwen python and and Multi_Agent_Unity_Environment
